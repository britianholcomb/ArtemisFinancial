# ArtemisFinancial

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**

Artemis Financial is a company that handles sensitive client data and financial transactions. They needed to make sure their software was secure to protect this data and avoid security risks. My job was to find and fix any weaknesses in their system that could expose client information or make them vulnerable to attacks.

**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**

I was thorough in finding and fixing security issues, making sure I didn’t miss any potential risks. Coding securely is crucial because it helps protect client information and prevents unauthorized access. Good security not only keeps data safe but also builds trust with clients, protects the company’s reputation, and reduces long-term risks.

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

The hardest part was finding unvalidated input paths, as these vulnerabilities required a deep understanding of how different parts of the code worked together. This was also useful to learn because it showed me how even small coding issues could create big security risks.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

I added several security layers, like secure logins, data encryption, input validation, and improved error handling. In the future, I would use tools like OWASP to scan for vulnerabilities, and I’d refer to guidelines like OWASP to help choose the best ways to fix security issues.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

I ran a series of functional and security tests to make sure the code worked well and was secure. After making changes, I ran more security scans to make sure I hadn’t introduced any new vulnerabilities, checking that everything still followed security best practices.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

I used OWASP for scanning and checking code security. These tools, along with secure coding practices like input validation and proper error handling, gave me useful insights that will help in future projects.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

I’d show future employers my process for finding and fixing software vulnerabilities, highlighting my secure coding skills and use of industry-standard tools. This assignment shows that I can build security into software development, which is key for creating secure and reliable applications.
